On **December 13th, 2023**, I graduated in **Computer Science (BSc)** at the University of Catania with **110/110 cum laude**.  

During my bachelorâ€™s studies, I built a solid background in **algorithms, software engineering, databases, operating systems, and computer networks**, which gave me the technical foundation to approach more advanced topics in Computer Science.    
My thesis was focused on **plant leaf image analysis**, developing a similarity measure based on **color clustering with K-Means**.  

This experience allowed me to combine my interest in computer science with real-world applications in biology, and it gave me the motivation to pursue more advanced research in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
