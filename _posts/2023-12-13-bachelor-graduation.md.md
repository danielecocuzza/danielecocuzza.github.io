I graduated in **Computer Science (BSc)** at the University of Catania with **110/110 cum laude**.  

During my bachelor’s studies, I built a solid background in **algorithms, software engineering, databases, operating systems, and computer networks**, which gave me the technical foundation to approach more advanced topics in Computer Science. 

My thesis focused on **plant leaf image analysis**, where I developed an algorithm to determine whether two leaf images belong to the same species. The method involved extracting dominant colors using **K-Means clustering** and comparing histograms through **cosine similarity**.
 

This experience gave me a solid foundation in computer science and encouraged me to pursue advanced studies at the Master’s level, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
