In **2020**, I graduated from **IT Archimede** with a **High School Diploma in Computer Science**, scoring **100/100 cum laude**.  

During my studies, I developed strong foundations in **Object-Oriented Programming, Operating Systems, Networking and Security, and Database Management**.  

This experience gave me the first solid base in computer science and motivated me to continue my academic journey at the university level.
