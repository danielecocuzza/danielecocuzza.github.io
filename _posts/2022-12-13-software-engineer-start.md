I started working as a **Software Engineer** at AITHO.  

My main role was focused on **backend development**, where I worked with **Java** and the **Spring Boot** framework, building and maintaining **REST APIs** and integrating with **MySQL** databases.  
I also used **JUnit** for testing, ensuring the reliability and quality of the applications.    

It marked the beginning of my professional journey, where I combined my academic background with real-world projects, strengthening both my technical skills and my ability to collaborate within dynamic teams.
