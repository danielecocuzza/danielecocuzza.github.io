On **September 9th, 2024**, I started working as a **DevOps Engineer** at **REETURN**.  

In this role, I focused on building and managing modern **CI/CD pipelines** and containerized infrastructures.  
I worked with technologies such as **Kubernetes, Jenkins, OpenShift, Docker, and Azure DevOps**, ensuring automated deployments, scalability, and reliability of applications.  

This experience allowed me to deepen my expertise in cloud-native solutions and DevOps practices, while contributing to the efficiency and innovation of the development process.
