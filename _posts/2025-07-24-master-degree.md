I obtained my **Master’s Degree in Computer Science – Data Science track** at the University of Catania with **110/110 cum laude**.  

My Master’s thesis focused on **paper document recognition**, where I developed a method to extract a fingerprint using **Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** and compared them through the **Bhattacharyya distance**.
This study achieved results beyond the current state of the art, proving the effectiveness of my method for document forgery detection.
  

This milestone marks the conclusion of a challenging and rewarding journey, and the beginning of new opportunities to apply my skills in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Data Science to real-world problems.
