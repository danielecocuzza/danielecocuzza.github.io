On **July 24th, 2025**, I obtained my **Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science â€“ Data Science track** at the University of Catania with **110/110 cum laude**.  

My masterâ€™s thesis focused on **advanced methods for document authentication**, leveraging **Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and backlight imaging**.  
The research achieved results beyond the current state of the art, proving the effectiveness of descriptors and deep learning approaches in detecting forgeries.  

This milestone marks the conclusion of a challenging and rewarding journey, and the beginning of new opportunities to apply my skills in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, and Data Science to real-world problems.
