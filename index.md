# Short Bio  

<div class="bio">
  <div class="bio__text">
I completed my Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Catania, graduating cum laude (110/110 with honors), where I built a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and data management. After that, I continued with a Master’s Degree in Computer Science (Data Science track), also graduating cum laude (110/110 with honors), with a focus on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. 

Alongside my academic path, I gained professional experience in the FinTech sector as a DevOps Engineer and Software Engineer, working with modern technologies such as Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, and cross-platform tools.

I am particularly interested in applying Artificial Intelligence and data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, and I use this site to share projects, notes, and updates from my work and research journey.
