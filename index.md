<div class="bio">
  <div class="bio__text">
I completed my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science at the University of Catania, graduating with full mark (110) cum laude, where I built a solid foundation in software development, algorithms, and data management. After that, I continued with a Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science (Data Science track), also graduating with full mark (110) cum laude, with a focus on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. 

During my academic journey, I also gained professional experience in the FinTech sector, where I worked as a DevOps and Software Engineer and contributed to projects using Kubernetes, Azure DevOps, and cross-platform technologies.

I am particularly interested in applying Artificial Intelligence and data-driven approaches to solve real-world problems, and I use this site to share projects, notes, and updates from my work and research journey.
